Title: SEEM3 High Throughput Exposure Prediction
Author: John Wambaugh [aut, cre]
Maintainer: John Wambuagh <wambaugh.john@epa.gov>
Description: A function for providing high throughput chemical intake
  rate (mg/kg bw/day)
  estimates for the median U.S. population. This model is described in 
  Ring et al. (2018) 
  <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.8b04056>. Chemicals with pre-computed
  predictions are identified by DTXSID (DSStox Structure ID's from 
  the CompTox Chemcials Dashboard
  http://comptox.epa.gov/dashboard/). New chemicals are characterized 
  by ToxPrint chemotypes and OPERA physico-chemical predictions.
  Returned value are select 
  quantiles of the posterior distribution of the estimate of the 
  population geometric mean exposure rate (assumed to be log-normal).
