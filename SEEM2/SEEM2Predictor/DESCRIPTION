Title: SEEM2 High Throughput Exposure Prediction
Author: R. Woodrow Setzer [aut, cre] and John Wambaugh [aut]
Maintainer: John Wambuagh <wambaugh.john@epa.gov>
Description: A function for providing high throughput exposure
  estimates for chemicals based on the Wambaugh et al. (2014) model
  <https://doi.org/10.1021/es503583j>. Chemicals are identified either 
  by CAS registry number or five chemical characteristics 
  (production volume and four binary variables that very coarsely 
  characterizes the chemical's use). Returned value are select 
  quantiles of the posterior distribution of the estimate of the 
  population geometric mean exposure rate (mg/kg bw/day).
